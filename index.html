          <h1>Infant Mortality from 2016 -2020 </h1>
          <p> Infant mortality is any death of a person under the age of 1 (UNICEF). This dashboard will explore how
            infant mortality varies worldwide from 2016-2020. With this initial discovery, we get to what typically high infant mortality is commonly associated with and explore the impact Covid-19 has on infant mortality. </p>

        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>From the map above, we can see that Africa had the highest infant mortality
            normalised values throughout the period. The other area of higher values was in the
            area surrounding India. But otherwise, the remaining countries had similar rates of infant mortality. It
            is also essential to know that there weren't massive amounts of changes for throughout the time period.  </p>

        <div id="vis2" class="vis-container"></div>
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>Looking at the continents' infant mortality, we see that Asia & Africa have
 the highest number of infant mortality. For this area chart as well, we can see from 2016 to 
            2020 that overall, there has been a decrease in infant mortality rates over the last couple of 
            years, which is a good thing to see, particularly from those countries in Africa & Asia. </p>

        <h3> Infant Mortality by GDP Per Capita  </h3>
        <div id="vis3" class="vis-container"></div>
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>From a GDP per capita front, we can see another similar result: the
            higher the GDP per capita amount typically results in a lower infant mortality rate. We
            can also see that smaller countries, in particular, appear to have large GDP per capita values
            and fewer deaths, which is what we expect since they would have fewer infants borns
            and fewer people to divide the countries' GDP. </p>

        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>When comparing life expectancy and infant mortality, we can see that a higher
            infant mortality rate typically means a lower life expectancy. This scatter plot
            also reinforces what was discussed above, as Asian and African countries have
            higher infant mortality numbers. </p>

        <h3> The impact of COVID-19 on Infant Mortality Rate  </h3>
        <div id="vis5" class="vis-container"></div>
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>Looking above, we can see that during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there
            was an increase in the number of infant mortalities as a rate. So,
            we can now see a slight increase in the infant mortality rate during
            the covid pandemic's first year. So, even though the number of infant mortalities
            went down, the rate increased. This is concerning, probably due to the strain placed on the healthcare system.  </p>
